This is a simple 2D platformer developed during my final weeks of internship at Sumo Digital. This is built using the PlayBuffer Framework. This game features a character that can move, jump and interact with platforms, coins, thorns and other game object. The objective of the game is demonstrated by interacting with NPCs.

The code is written entirely in C++ and uses the PlayBuffer Framework for game development. The game features the following mechanics:
1) The player can contol the playable character using the arrow keys. The player can move left, right and jump by pressing the space bar
2) The player can stand on platforms and jump from one to another.
3) The player can collect coins scattered throughout the level by colliding with them
4) There are thorn hazards in the game that will damage the player upon collision.
5) Dialogues appear when the player interacts with other NPCs in the game.
